PlainCalc is a buttonless, algebraic-entry, mathematical calculator for Mac OS X with variables and functions. To use PlainCalc, type an expression or assignment and press Return or Enter. Unlike most calculators I've seen, PlainCalc allows you to indicate multiplication by juxtaposition, e.g., you can write 2πr instead of 2*π*r.

After downloading, build with Xcode.  The project is set to deploy on Mac OS X 10.6 or later, with i386 and x86_64 architectures.

The project is under the zlib/libPNG public license.
